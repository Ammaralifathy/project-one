    <h2>
        a story, i love you
    </h2>
    <h1>story is very beutiful </h1>
    <p>With that amount of words, you don‚Äôt have much real-estate to ‚Äúdevelop‚Äù a character, but rather to show the
        et the reader to know this person in a single sentence or two through
        dialogue and/or action.
        ‚ÄúMichael rushed down the sidewalk in the frigid air, trying to avoid being late for the third time that month,
        when he heard a gruff voice say, ‚ÄòSir, do you have a dollar?‚Äô He looked down to see a homeless man, swaddled in
        ratty clothes to protect him from the cold. He hesitated for a moment, looking at his watch.
        Then he said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll do you one better. Let‚Äôs go get a cup of coffee.‚Äô
        It won‚Äôt win a Pulitzer, and I used too many words here even, but in two sentences, we can see that Michael
        cares more about this man freezing in the cold than his job.
        As for plot, you won‚Äôt have a normal three act structure or traditional plot with a story this short. While
        outdated, and not appropriate for every situation, I love Poe‚Äôs concept of the singular effect. These short
        stories need to hit home in a brief amount of time. You could even look at my two sentences as a complete work.
        Focus more on what you are trying to say and how it is delivered rather than trying to plan out a step by step
        plot.

        The shorter the story, the more you should experiment.

    <h2>chapter 344444üöÄ</h2> <!--this is a header two-->
    <p>The first place that I can well remember was a large pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it. Some shady
        trees leaned over it, and rushes and water-lilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked
        into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master's house, which stood by the roadside;
        at the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook overhung by a steep bank.

        While I was young I lived upon my mother's milk, as I could not eat grass. In the daytime I ran by her side, and
        at night I lay down close by her. When it was hot we used to stand by the pond in the shade of the trees, and
        when it was cold we had a nice warm shed near the grove.

        "Bad boy!" he said, "bad boy! to chase the colts. This is not the first time, nor the second, but it shall be
        the last. There‚Äîtake your money and go home; I shall not want you on my farm again." So we never saw Dick any
        more. Old Daniel, the man who looked after the horses, was just as gentle as our master, so we were well off.
